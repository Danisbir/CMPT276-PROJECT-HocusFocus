Hocus Focus
 
Abstract:
Hocus Focus is an online web application that utilizes the Pomodoro technique which allows not just a single user, 
but multiple users to collaborate in completing a task or multiple tasks in a given interval of time. Users are able to create rooms, 
after signing up/login, to enable finishing tasks of a group project. In the room, users can communicate with each other through a 
chatting feature which allows them to divide their work efficiently or to discuss anything regarding their tasks. Hocus Focus' main 
feature is to set a timer for a certain task (ideally for 25 minutes), then you will be rewarded with a 5 minutes break. After 4 cycles, 
then you will be rewarded with a long break for 15 minutes. Furthermore, the future implementation of this app will include a feature of a report, 
where you can track the productivity of each session of the meeting/work, by providing the user the details of their work reports. Additionally, 
the app will be incorporated with an API that allows users to access calming music or meditation exercises during the break time.

Overview of existing system:
One of the major problems people face when working or studying is fatigue and procrastination. The reason is that many people have the tendency 
to study or work continuously over a long period of time without any breaks, which severely reduces our focus over time. A solution to this 
problem is to use the podomoro system. The pomodoro technique is basically breaking down work into intervals, usually 25 minutes, with a short 
break at each interval. Using the Pomodoro technique helps people be more productive by having breaks and not procrastinating, since the work 
is divided into smaller chunks. This would be a very helpful tool for both studying and working, making it very useful for both students and workers. 
Current existing pomodoro timers include Tomato Timer, Pomofocus.io, Pomodor, Marinara Timer, and Tomato Timers. At its core, all of them have a
 pomodoro timer with a customizable time interval. However, some of them expanded the app to include a to-do list, statistical tracking on how 
long you work, and more options for the sound alerts. One such example is Pomofocus.io, which enables you to login so that you can keep 
track of your work rate and your to-do list. It also has the ability to switch to different sounds for the timer and you can turn on a 
ticking sound for your work. Meanwhile, Tomato Timers, which is one of the most famous pomodoro timer, only includes the basics of a 
pomodoro timer, only having the timer itself, and the ability to change the duration for each time interval and the sound of the timer. 

Improvement:
Coming to the improvisation of the idea which is taken from current  pomodoro apps, we aim to allow multiple users to collaboratively work together
 on a particular main task. The users will be able to login/sign up and create private rooms where the users can work together in a room and do 
their respective tasks and eventually achieve the final goal. The original pomodoro app just allows the user to do solo tasks while this new feature 
can allow the users to work in a team, split their tasks, take breaks and eventually accomplish their final goal. This project will make life better 
by allowing the users to work collaboratively and with time management. Moreover, the group members will be able to chat among themselves
 Furthermore, the users will be able to add, delete, update their tasks and finish it with certain breaks within it. 
 We are also thinking of including some fun parts during the intervals for break where the user will be able to access the 
free exercise/meditation API or calm music API.   A small break with a mix of some exercise and meditation steps can boost an individual’s mindset to complete his/her task. 
The target audience is the general public, especially the university students and professional workers since these  groups of people have poor time management skills, 
and this app is meant to help them allocate their time to be productive efficiently. At home, users can use this application to do home-related tasks 
(cleaning, preparing meals, doing laundry, etc.), without procrastinating.

The epics of the project include:
* Creating public/private rooms for the users to collaborate/chat
* To-do list
* Measure of productivity through report
* Activities suggestion for breaks
